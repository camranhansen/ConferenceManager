# Setup Instructions
1. Create a folder named `data` in `phase1/`
2. Copy [user_data.csv](user_data.csv) and [event_data.csv](event_data.csv) from `phase1/README`
(where one would find this file) and into the newly 
created `phase1/data` directory
3. Create a new run configuration (application), and set
 the main class to csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.EntryPoint, JRE to 1.8, and
 and the working directory to the `phase1` folder.
4. Run csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.EntryPoint with these aforementioned configurations.

# Creating csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.users
## Through TextUI
- It is **VERY STRONGLY** recommended to create a 
new user this way. Simply log in via the premade admin account that 
innately has access to all methods (username: `admin`, password: `admin`),
and create a user from there, selecting the permission template desired.
See Template and Permission in the csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.users package for more clarification.

## Through the pre-loaded file
- Add a new row to user_data.csv in the data package, with the format
`"username","password","permission1,permission2,permission3"`.
The quotation marks are necessary as are the commas.

# Creating csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.events
Likewise, creating csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.events should be done through the UI, 
as ID's are stored as an instant, meaning they are a very long, unreadable number.

# Attending csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.events
Anyone with the event_self_enroll method can enrol themselves in an event.
 Follow these easy steps!
1. Use the `VIEW_ALL_EVENTS` permission to view the csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.events that this use can attend!
2. In an external notepad, copy-paste the event location (e.g. Main Room), and the event time of the desired event, 
concatenating them to form the string `"event_location"+"event_time"`. For example, for the event Debugging 102, 
the ID string would be `Main Room2020-12-02T09:00:00Z`. You can also just copy-paste the event id from the `event_data` 
csv file.
3. Select `event_self_enroll` (or other_enroll if you want to enroll another user), and then paste the event ID of the desired event.
We realize that this method is not very user-friendly, but we devoted our team time to other things, and will be implementing a 
much nicer method of enrolling in an event through a csc.zerofoureightnine.conferencemanager.menu of options.
